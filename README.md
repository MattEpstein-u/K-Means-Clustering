# K-Means Clustering Visualization

This is an interactive web application that demonstrates the K-Means clustering algorithm. You can visualize the algorithm step-by-step, generate random data points, and adjust the number of clusters (K).

## How to Use

1.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**
2.  **Generate Data:** Click the "Generate Data" button to create a random set of data points on the canvas. You can specify the number of points to generate.
3.  **Set K:** Choose the desired number of clusters (K) using the input field.
4.  **Start the Algorithm:**
    *   Click "Start" to run the algorithm automatically.
    *   Click "Next Step" to walk through the algorithm one iteration at a time.
5.  **Observe:**
    *   The colored dots are the data points.
    *   The larger squares with crosses are the centroids of the clusters.
    *   The color of a data point indicates the cluster it belongs to.
6.  **Reset:** Click "Reset" to clear the canvas and start over.

## Files
